The code is convergent at t=0 for initial data with spherically symmetric and non-spherically symmetric scalar field with profile stype=0,1. The code is unstable for this data. Moreover, there are errors from indices going out of bounds in the derivative stencils when we use more than 4 cores (so the code seems to be dependent of the number of cores, which is clearly not something we want).
