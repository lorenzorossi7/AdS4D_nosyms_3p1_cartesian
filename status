STATUS OF THIS BRANCH:
We implemented Schwarzschild-AdS analytic initial data in horizon penetrating Cartesian coordinates.
Calculation of AdS quasi-local stress energy tensor and AdS mass should be implemented.
Convergence at t=0 is good as expected. For gauge 3 or gauge 4 with small c1,c2 and c3, the code is stable until late times. It is also convergent for quite late times although it starts losing convergence at some point near the x,y axes.
Gauge 3 and gauge 4 with c1<=2.0,c2<=0.05,c3<=0.1 are equivalent.
Derivative stencils have been rearranged so that no errors arise and arrays don't go out of boundaries.
We excise inside a region determined by the initial black hole radius at all time steps. We don't use an AH finder for now.
We have implemented Background Error Subtraction Technique (BEST). Runs using BEST are shorther than those without BEST, this seems wrong and should be fixed or understood.
