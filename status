STATUS OF THIS BRANCH:
3+1 Cartesian code.
We excise inside a region determined by the initial black hole radius at all time steps. We don't use an AH finder for now.
New derivative stencils in z have been tested.
Convergence at t=0 is good as expected for analytic Schwarzschild-AdS initial data. For BH Schwarzschild radius=0.6, ex_rbuf=0.1, Nans form too early in the evolution of runs with gauge 3 and L0/L1 resolution near the excision surface. For BH Schwarzschild radius=5.0, ex_rbug=0.35, L0 resolution and gauge 3, runs last until T=12.487500 without stopping.
Convergence and stability at later times, higher resolutions and different values of the parameters needs to be tested.
