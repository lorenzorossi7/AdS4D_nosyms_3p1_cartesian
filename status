STATUS OF THIS BRANCH:
We implemented Schwarzschild-AdS analytic initial data in horizon penetrating Cartesian coordinates.
Calculation of AdS quasi-local stress energy tensor and AdS mass should be implemented.
Convergence at t=0 is good as expected. Convergence and stability at later times must be tested.
Derivative stencils have been rearranged so that no errors arise and arrays don't go out of boundaries.
We excise inside a region determined by the initial black hole radius at all time steps. We don't use an AH finder for now, set the parameter no_find_apph to 0 to call the AH finder.
