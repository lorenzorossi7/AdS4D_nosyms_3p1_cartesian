STATUS OF THIS BRANCH:
2+1 Cartesian code in 3D grid (we extended the declaration of grid functions to a 3D grid and included the new grid functions in the calling of all functions, but nothing depends on these functions yet, i.e. they have not been used; nothing should depend on the value of the 3rd coordinate z).
We implemented Schwarzschild-AdS analytic initial data in horizon penetrating Cartesian coordinates.
Calculation of AdS quasi-local stress energy tensor and AdS mass should be implemented.
The code has been tested for analytic Schwarzschild-AdS initial data mainly.
For this data, convergence at t=0 is good as expected. For gauge3, the code is stable until late times. Convergence at later times has not been tested but it is expected to be as good as in the 2+1 code, so good enough to trust the output.
For some data obtained by solving the Hamiltonian constraint, the constraint is not solved within the tolerance in 25 iterations.
Gauge 3 and gauge 4 with c1<=2.0,c2<=0.05,c3<=0.1 should be equivalent (as we saw in the 2+1 code).
Derivative stencils have been rearranged so that no errors arise and arrays don't go out of boundaries.
We excise inside a region determined by the initial black hole radius at all time steps. We don't use an AH finder for now.
